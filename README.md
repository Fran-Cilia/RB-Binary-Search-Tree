# RB-Binary-Search-Tree
This is an application of a Red Black Binary Search Tree which was an assignment from my Intermediate Data Structures class
For this project I built red black tree functionality on top of a binary search tree program that I had created earlier in the term

Red Black Trees must have the following properties:
1. A node is either red or black
2. The root and leaves (NIL) are black
3. If a node is red, then its children are black
4. All paths from a node to its NIL descendants contain the same number of black nodes
